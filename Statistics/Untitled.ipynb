    "Consider a dataset containing the heights (in centimeters) of 1000 individuals. The\n",
    "mean height is 170 cm with a standard deviation of 10 cm. The dataset is approximately\n",
    "normally distributed, and its skewness is approximately zero. Based on this information,\n",

    "    a. What percentage of individuals in the dataset have heights between 160 cm\n",

    "    b. If we randomly select 100 individuals from the dataset, what is the probability\n",
    "        that their average height is greater than 175 cm?\n",
    "    c. Assuming the dataset follows a normal distribution, what is the z-score\n",
    "        corresponding to a height of 185 cm?\n",
    "    d. We know that 5% of the dataset has heights below a certain value. What is\n",
    "        the approximate height corresponding to this threshold?\n",
